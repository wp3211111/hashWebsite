### Question ###

  q1: "Q1:What is Block hash？",
                    a1: "A block hash is the DNA of a piece of data, and each block hash is unique, random, and unbreakable",
                    q2: "Q2:What is blockchain？",
                    a2: "Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way that it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then linked together via cryptography",
                    q3: "Q3:Centralized wallet? Decentralized wallets? Why can't centralized wallets inquiry transfers？",
                    a3: "To give an example: your own wallet address is A, you transfer 10 USDT to address E, but you use the transaction hash to inquiry, you can only inquiry the service provider randomly a certain ledger address B (or C or D, etc.) and E transfer. In the same way, E can't know if the 10 USDT were transferred by you, because E can only see that the ledger address B transferred 10 USDT to him. This is why centralized wallets cannot inquiry real transfer information on the blockchain",
                    q4: "Q4:Why do I win or not win consecutively？",
                    a4: 'First of all, the first consecutive number of unsuccessful wins are small probability events (<a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B0%8F%E6%A6%82%E7%8E%87%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6/7339473" target="_blank" class="c-link">small probability event definition</a>), and secondly, winning and not winning the lottery are random events, and the frequency of random events will tend to a stable value. In the case of non-iteration, the probability of things appearing is equal for everyone, in this case, everyone is fair. At the same time, random events will obey the law of large numbers (under the condition that the experiment is unchanged, the experiment is repeated many times, and the frequency of random events is similar to its definition of the law of probability large numbers), and the probability of winning or not winning the lottery will tend to a stable value in the case of increasing transfer frequency. So please continue to transfer money, as the frequency of transfers increases, the total probability of winning the lottery will increase',
                    q5: "Q5:Why is the account funds will delayed？",
                    a5: 'There are many well-known public chains around the world (<a href="https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/271935601941038645.html" target="_blank" class="c-link">click to view the world\'s well-known public chains</a>) that support USDT transfers, and our platform is based on Tron TRC20 technology. So the transfer address of our platform belongs to USDT-TRC20, you should choose USDT-TRC20; if you choose another type, the lucky hash will not receive your USDT, which will cause losses to both you and the lucky hash',
